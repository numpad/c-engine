# Ideas

This project is very much work-in-progress. Here are some ideas to make an actual game with it.


### Lore, Campaign
 
No idea yet.


### Milestones

There are two epic milestones which guide the whole project.

 1. Develop a fun and deep game for myself to play on my phone.
 2. Design and polish the game enough for my friends to (voluntarily) play it, and potentially monetize some content.
